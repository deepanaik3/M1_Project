## Introduction
Travel is a major and expanding industry in all countries. The bus reservation system is in charge of keeping track of each passenger's information. It also entails the upkeep of information such as bus schedules and details. We witnessed the Bus Reservation System in action, and after going over it, we discovered that there are numerous tasks that must be completed manually. It takes a long time and results in several errors when entering data. As a result, they've had a lot of troubles in the past, and they've had a lot of customer conflicts. We propose this computerised reservation system to tackle the aforesaid problem while also retaining records of passenger details, seat availability, price per seat, bill production, and other items. We can reserve tickets using this programme from anywhere in the globe, over the phone or on the internet. Customers can check the bus's availability and reserve specific seats. The project includes and tests a variety of restrictions to ensure that the user supplies only valuable information and that validation is carried out efficiently.

# Research
## Objective
The project Transport Company's procedure is now being maintained manually by the Bus ticket reservation system, which is a very time intensive operation. It deals with ticket booking and transportation maintenance in the transportation business, thus it becomes a highly time-consuming duty for the ticket booking transporter to keep track of these details in order to perform the assignment on time. The bus ticket booking system not only interacts with carriers' own vehicles, but also with other types of system transport vehicles that are available from other transporters. To create a software application that supports the project Travel Agency Automation and can automate all of the laborious procedures associated with buying tickets at a travel agency.
